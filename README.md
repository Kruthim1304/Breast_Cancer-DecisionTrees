# Breast_Cancer-DecisionTrees

The proposed data mining model is used to help medical researchers to analyse and predict the breast cancer cells in human body by analysing the breast cancer dataset and thus determine if the resultant cells are cancerous or not.The proposed model tends to exhibit the use of Decision tree classification algorithm implementation using Jupyter Notebook in Python to visualize the data and find out the optimal accuracy of the model.
